# Circuit 1
  This circuit takes in a 4-bit 5-4-2-1 Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) input from a DIP switch and decodes it using and, or and xor logic gates, representing the output via a 7 segment common cathode display.

  My motivation for making this circuit was to find simple expressions for all outputs on the display from the given BCD and use boolean algebra to simplify the circuit to reduce the number of gates necessary.
