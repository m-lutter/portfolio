## Circuit 3: Clock-Register Circuit
This Circuit uses a 555 timer connected in an astable configuration as a clock signal for a 4-bit register. This register takes in two push button inputs allowing the user to control the output, which is then displayed on four LEDs. The buttons also allow the user to load an initial state. Additionally, a DIP input inserts an obstacle into the circuit, collision with which interrupts the clock signal.
This circuit was built to closely mimic the player movement for my design project.

# How it works
By default, the LEDs are all off except for the blinking LED indicating the clock signal. Pressing both buttons simultaneously initializes the 'game' by loading the shift register, lighting up the bottom LED to start (and the third LED if the DIP input is HIGH). From here, pressing the top button will move the player up one LED on the rising edge of the clock signal, pressing the bottom button will move the player down, and pressing niether will hold the position of the player static.

This is achieved by connecting the push buttons to the S0 and S1 inputs of the shift register and by connecting the input pins to GND and VCC for the starting position so that pressing both buttons causes the shift register to load this value.

The clock signal is generated by connecting a 555 timer in an astable configuration. The signal is then passed through a hex inverter with Schmitt trigger inputs to ensure valid logic levels are passed to the shift register. Resistor and capacitor values were chosen to create a 1Hz clock cycle frequency from the equation f = 1/(C*(R1+2R2)), in this case with R1 = R2.

The collision circuit works by first allowing the DIP input to light up the third LED to show an obstacle in that spot. This obstacle is static so long as the DIP input is HIGH. If the player does not pass into the space containing the obstacle, the clock will continue, and the player is free to move. If the player moves up or down into the space containing the obstacle, the clock signal is interrupted. This is achieved in this circuit somewhat differently than it would be implemented in the final design project since this circuit does not use RGB LEDs, so some additional logic is required. 

In this case a NAND is used to OR the signal from the DIP and the signal from the third output of the shift register to light up the LED when appropriate, and to NAND these two signals together to detect a collision. This signal is then connected to the discharge pin of the 555 timer. In the event of a collision, this signal will be LOW, so the capacitor will never charge and the clock will never change.

To reset this circuit, it is necessary to turn off the obstacle and press both buttons. In the design project, flip flops will be used, so pressing both buttons can be connected to the clear pins of the counters to simultaneously reset the obstacles and player, but this circuit does not have that ability.

# Design Decisions
- Clock Speed: I chose a slow clock speed so the output would be easier to control and view, rather than a fast one so that the user has some time to react to the new output and enter inputs for the next one. In the real game the clock speed will be faster which will lead to a more responsive feel.

# Conclusion
This circuit is a shift register circuit game which uses a clock signal and user input to feed into a shift register and output the result. Additionally, a collision detection and reset mechanism have been partially developed (as far as I can go without incorporating more components or building the full circuit).
I chose to make this circuit because it simulates the movement and collision in my design project game.
