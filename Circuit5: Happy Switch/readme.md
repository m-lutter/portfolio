## Circuit 5: Happy Switch
This circuit uses an SR Latch and a pair of multiplexers to display a happy or a sad face on a grid of LEDs.
By pressing the top button, the screen displays a smiley face, and the image persists even after the button is released, and even if the button is pressed again.
Pressing the bottom button resets the screen to a frowny face.
