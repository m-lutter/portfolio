# Digital Systems Portfolio
This repo contains 8 circuits designed throughout a semester of digital systems, and a final project.

These circuits demonstrate core principles of digital systems logic and design, restricted to basic components. The topics explored include binary systems, circuit optimization, combinational switching circuits, multiplexers, decoders, encoders, latches, flip flops, registers, counters, sequential switching circuits, and wired and stored program processor concepts(e.g. ROM).

Images and descriptions are provided, along with a parts list to create each circuit on a breadboard.
