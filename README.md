# Digital Systems Portfolio
This repo contains 8 circuits designed throughout a semester of digital systems, and a final project.

These circuits demonstrate core principles of digitals system design, restricted to basic components.

Images and descriptions are provided, along with a parts list to create each circuit on a breadboard.
